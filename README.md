generate_bloom.cpp
- batch addition
- batch inversion
- calculating just x coordinate for the batch - 1
- calculating x,y for the last of the batch entry (used as the next startPoint)

generate_bloom2.cpp
JLP Batch Reference Logic:
- batch addition/subtraction
- batch inversion
- center of the group
- calculating just x coordinate for the batch

./generate_bloom uses multiple threads to fill in the bloomfilter binary.
to split the space evenly, number of cores needs to be some power of two value.
actual number of processing cores but equal to some power of two value(2,4,8,16,32,64,...)
divided by 2
actual cores = 8  8 / 2 = 4 cores

./point_search is totally scalable and has no such restriction.
can set any desirable number of cores to use but divided by 2.
because we have two search paths : addition and subtraction.
setting cores beyond hardware concurrency will not yield any additional performance.
